        question: '1. Create a Budget',
        answer: 'Track your income and expenses. A good rule of thumb is the 50/30/20 rule: 50% needs, 30% wants, and 20% savings or debt repayment.'
    }
    ,
    {
        question: '2. Set Savings Goals',
        answer: 'Set specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals. For example, save $5,000 for a vacation in 2 years.'

    {
        question: '3. Use the 24-Hour Rule',
        answer: 'Before making a big purchase, give yourself at least 24 hours to think about it. This helps avoid impulse buys and allows you to evaluate whether you truly need the item.'
    }
    ,
    {
        question: '4. Automate Savings',
        answer: 'Set up automatic transfers to your savings account. Treat savings like a bill that must be paid each month.'
    }
    ,
    {
        question: '5. Prioritize Needs Over Wants',
        answer: 'Focus on essentials like housing, transportation, food, and health before splurging on non-essentials. Itâ€™s okay to treat yourself occasionally, but make sure your basics are covered first.'
